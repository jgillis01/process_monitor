# ProcessMonitor

A ProcessMonitor using SSH connections

This repo contains the code that was used in the 2018 Elixir Conference talk titled "Using
Elixir and OTP to Monitor Legacy Infrastructure."

You can follow along by checking out each commit and viewing the code.  This
repo also contains the [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) files used to play back terminal session
recordings.  You can download/install the player to play back these files.
